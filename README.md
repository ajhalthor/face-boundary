# Face-Boundary
This program takes an image as input and plots:
1. Tip of Nose
2. Boundary of the Face
3. plots points on the boundary at intervals of 2 degrees along the right side (from our perspective) of face. This can easily be changed in the code for the left side.
4. Connects the 2 points with a line
